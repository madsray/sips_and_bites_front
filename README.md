  "Why just limit happy to one hour?"
### Overview
  Have you ever wanted a place where you and other people could add your favorite happy hours in your city? Or an app that if you wanted the best spots for happy hour in regards to food you didn't have to search through alcohol happy hours? This was my goal. To make a an app that was a one stop shop for all these needs.
### Deployment
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that we used as our web application deployment model. To view live, visit https://sips-bites.herokuapp.com/.
### Approach
  I wanted a simple to use app that anyone could use for a resource to find happy hours.
### Technical Difficulties
  My biggest trouble was planning this app. When I first started I had it categorizing with weeks. I thought there might be an easier way to do categories since stores have tons and tons of subcategories, so I tried using ancestry gem that I was reading about online. I could not get my data to even seed so after a day, I scraped it. I tried a few more ideas of rearranging models, but honestly I went back to my original idea and it was a lot easier to make categories than I was expecting. I wish I would have kept week days in there too, but it was a lot of inception and for the length of time given for this project I took it out. I would love to eventually add it in again.
### Future Implementations
  In the future, I plan on adding a create function for cities, so that users can add their cities and the app expands.
  I also want to create a login feature that users can add happy hours to their profiles of ones that they want to try.
  I also would like to incorporate a user calendar so that it populates to Monday on a calendar and they have the option of syncing it to their phones calendar or sharing this event with another user.
  Also add addresses to bars.
### Tech Used
